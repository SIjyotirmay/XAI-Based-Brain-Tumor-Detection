## 🧠 Problem Statement
Manual brain tumor detection and segmentation from MRI scans is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Although deep learning models achieve high accuracy, their **black-box nature** limits trust and adoption in clinical environments.

This project aims to develop an **accurate and interpretable AI-based framework** for brain tumor detection using MRI images.

## 🏗️ Methodology
The proposed system consists of the following stages:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- MRI resizing to 256×256
- Z-score normalization
- Data augmentation (flip, rotation, noise, elastic deformation)

### 2. Tumor Segmentation
- **ResUNet-based architecture**
- Residual connections for improved gradient flow
- Hybrid loss: Binary Cross-Entropy + Dice Loss

### 3. Tumor Classification
- **ResNet-18 classifier**
- Input: segmented tumor region
- Output classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor

### 4. Explainability (XAI)
- **Grad-CAM** applied to segmentation and classification models
- Visual heatmaps highlighting decision-relevant regions

## 📊 Dataset
**BRISC (Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification) Dataset**

- Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI images
- Expert-annotated segmentation masks
- Tumor classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary

## 📈 Results

### Segmentation Performance
- **Dice Score:** 0.8423  
- **IoU:** 0.7664  

### Classification Performance
- **Training Accuracy:** 99.08%  
- **Testing Accuracy:** 98.60%  

The results demonstrate accurate tumor localization, smooth boundaries, and robust classification across tumor types.
